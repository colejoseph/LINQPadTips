# LINQPad: More than a Scratchpad

LINQPad is an amazing utility but much of its power lies hidden just below the surface. Here you'll find the code samples I use to showcase several of the more interesting or useful features that are included in LINQPad.

## Examples

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| MyExtensionsSnippets | Code necessary for the other samples. Paste the contents into your ```My Extensions``` file |
| 01 - Text Formatting | Shows the Util methods for changing how strings are formatted by ```Dump()``` |
| 02 - Customizing Dump | Used in conjunction with ```MyExtensionsSnippets.linq``` to show how the ```ToDump()``` method can change how objects are formatted |
| 03 - Auto Scroll Results | ```Sets the AutoScrollResults``` property to ensure that the results pane automatically scrolls to display the most recently dumped item |
| 04 - Dump Container and Progress Bar | Uses LINQPad's DumpContainer and ProgressBar controls to monitor progress through an operation |
| 05 - Caching | Simulates caching the results of an expensive query |
| 06 - NuGet | Shows adding a NuGet package to a LINQPad query |
| 07A - QueryPeople<br />07B - SendEmail | Shows how to chain scripts together at the console with ```LpRun``` and how to use LINQPad's built-in password manager |
| 08 - Fluent Exceptions | Shows how the ```Util.Try``` method handles exceptions in a fluent manner |
